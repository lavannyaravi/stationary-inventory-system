OK logic also
but now the system is based on room
room is primary
if want to change room depend on seater
sorry typo
database must change
u dont get it rite
yea
ok 
its like now
seater depend on room
where user doesnt hv to key in seater or choose
one choose room the seater also auto populate
u want like choose seater and room auto populate--yes ne maybe show in the dropdownlist the possible output'like if they choose 2 seater show all the 2 seater rooms in dropdownlist

u know for this
hv to redo all 200 lines of code again
:O
aiyayooooo
im using ajax to find seater and to populate in fields after select room like this
all those ajax
and wrote php in javascript to get the students name for the seater

so if wana chge like urs
must find seater plus match with the room for that number of seater is empty or nt
ok wat ur saying logic
but its not a user journey problem in this situation
bcz when their click room ny the seater populate, user can easily change
again u might say if alot of room mean hassle rite
yes
what if like this, when admin key in room no, they key in with the level info and seater
meaning now for room no they ny key in no right "110"
if they key in like this "L1-110 (2 seater)" is this possible?
ok wait
ne if change the data type for room_no in the database ah? why ar?
bcs that day i tried key in like this 'L1-110'
it didnt masuk database
maybe bcs its in int kot?? nt sure
wait ar is this ok
yes very much ok ne :D and then one more thing ne,, is it possible if the std select just one roommate if they choose 2 seater.....meaning if they choose seater of 4, they can only select 3 roommates ny.wait ok?
ahhh okay ne i did something that day it showed error hehehe
 yeahtqt hv to be careful
 cz php inside javascirpt ok ne tqmuch

 so can u change  example it goes to a welcome page then only choose change pass 
IS THIS FOR ADMIN OR STAFF ?admin ne staff all okLOING ADMIN ah?
ehh soryy for staff ..confuse dy
GOT 68 FILE TO CHANGE HUHU
anne or do u hv any idea to make it simple
bcs right u see ah when the staff login everytime the update pass will appear right?

maybe if u think dashboard as sumting different then should bring another meanign then
aiyayooo :( so there is no other way ist can can
hv to add another page and add in that 68 pages
haha
